\title{Clean Household and Individual Number Data}
\usage{
clean_HH_number(database, hh_number, ind_number, hhsize)
}
\arguments{
\item{database}{A dataframe containing the household and individual number data.}

\item{hh_number}{A numeric column representing the household count.}

\item{ind_number}{A numeric column representing the number of individuals.}

\item{hhsize}{An \strong{integer value} representing the estimated \strong{average household size} (from MSNA).}
}
\value{
A dataframe with \strong{imputed and corrected} \code{hh_number} and \code{ind_number} values.
}
\description{
This function ensures logical consistency between household (\code{hh_number}) and individual (\code{ind_number}) counts
based on an estimated \strong{average household size (\code{hhsize})}, which is a single integer value derived from
the most recent MSNA (Multi-Sector Needs Assessment).
}
\details{
\itemize{
\item If \code{hh_number} is missing but \code{ind_number} is available, it estimates \code{hh_number = round(ind_number / hhsize)}.
\item If \code{ind_number} is missing but \code{hh_number} is available, it estimates \code{ind_number = hh_number * hhsize}.
\item If \code{hh_number > ind_number}, it replaces \code{hh_number} with \code{hh_number = round(ind_number / hhsize)}.
}
}
\examples{
library(dplyr)

data <- data.frame(
  hh_number = c(10, NA, 15, 50, NA, 30),
  ind_number = c(50, 30, NA, 100, 60, 20)
)

hhsize_value <- 5  # estimated average household size from MSNA
cleaned_data <- clean_HH_number(data, "hh_number", "ind_number", hhsize_value)
print(cleaned_data)
