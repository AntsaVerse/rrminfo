\item{prev_postrrm_date}{The forecast date for post-RRM response positioning.}

\item{alert_status_col}{The column name indicating alert status (e.g., "Valid√©e").}

\item{valid_status}{The value in \code{alert_status_col} representing a validated alert.}

\item{validation_date_col}{The column name containing the alert validation date.}

\item{postrrm_start_date_col}{The column name containing the start date of post-RRM response.}

\item{postrrm_start_threshold}{The minimum date threshold for post-RRM response forecasting (default: "2023-01-01").}
}
\value{
A dataframe containing the original dataset with additional binary indicators.
\subsection{\strong{Indicator Definitions}}{

\strong{A}: Alerts validated before the previous period that still need post-RRM positioning.
\itemize{
\item \strong{A1}: Should have started before the previous period.
\item \strong{A2}: Should have started between the previous and current period.
\item \strong{A3}: Should start after the current period.
\item \strong{A4}: Total alerts needing post-RRM before the current period.
\item \strong{A5}: Total alerts needing post-RRM after the previous period.
\item \strong{A6}: Should start before the previous period or after the current period.
}

\strong{B}: Alerts validated between the previous and current period.
\itemize{
\item \strong{B1}: Should have started before the previous period.
\item \strong{B2}: Should have started between the previous and current period.
\item \strong{B3}: Should start after the current period.
\item \strong{B4}: Total alerts needing post-RRM before the current period.
\item \strong{B5}: Total alerts needing post-RRM after the previous period.
\item \strong{B6}: Should start before the previous period or after the current period.
}

\strong{C}: Alerts registered by post-RRM actors between the previous and current period.
\itemize{
\item \strong{C1-C6}: Same breakdown as A and B categories.
}

\strong{D}: Alerts requiring post-RRM positioning at the current period.
\itemize{
\item \strong{D1-D6}: Same breakdown as A and B categories.
}

\strong{Final Indicators}
\itemize{
\item \strong{forecast}: Future alerts requiring post-RRM but not yet registered.
\item \strong{arrears}: Alerts overdue for post-RRM but still not registered.
}
}
}
\description{
This function adds indicators for tracking alerts that require post-RRM (Rapid Response Mechanism) positioning.
It categorizes alerts into different groups based on their validation status, response forecast dates,
and whether they have been registered for a post-RRM response.
